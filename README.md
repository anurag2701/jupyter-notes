# Jupyter Notebook

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Setup Instructions

- **Add Dependencies:**

  Ensure that all required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

  ```plaintext
  matplotlib
  numpy
  pandas
  # Add other dependencies as needed


## Build and Run the Docker Container:

To build and run the Docker container, execute the following commands:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This will build the Docker image and start the Jupyter Notebook server. The server will be accessible at [`http://localhost:8888`](https://localhost:8888) .

## Access the Docker Container Shell:

If you need to access the Docker container's shell (for debugging or manual operations), you can do so by running:

```
docker run -it my_jupyter_image /bin/bash
```
Replace `my_jupyter_image` with the name of your Docker image if different.
